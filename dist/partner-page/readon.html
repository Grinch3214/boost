						We provide free access to the platform for you as long as you keep releasing videos (or other content) about Boosteroid. Follow the <a href="https://cloud.boosteroid.com/auth/register" target="_blank">link</a> right now to create your account.

						<span>NOTE!</span> Please note that you will be able to launch any free-to-play game on Boosteroid, but for games marked as "payment required", you need to have a purchased licensed copy from an official digital distributor (Steam/Epic/Origin).

				<h3 class="readon__box-title">What content should you create?</h3>
				<ul class="readon__box-list">
					<li class="readon__box-item">
						It's totally up to you, what kind of content you want to publish about Boosteroid. Our ecommendation is to start with a general review of the service. After that, you can record gameplay videos, news, useful information, and so on.  
					</li>
					<li class="readon__box-item">
						We don’t have strict requirements on what you should or should not say about the service, but we would like to kindly ask you to mention in your videos that the experience with any cloud-gaming service, including Boosteroid, is highly dependent on the connection and device of a particular user and may vary between different people. That's why every user needs to check their connection with Boosteroid before purchasing a subscription. 
					</li>
					<li class="readon__box-item">
						Also, please share with your subscribers that Boosteroid does not provide free access to licensed games, that’s why games listed as "payment required" need to be purchased in the official digital distribution store (Epic, Origin, Steam, etc.).
